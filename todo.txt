* Convert Total Economic Growth to Total Net Worth
  - So I sold the Si today and the issue that i knew was always there reared its ugly head...the program doesn't track physical assets. It also became apparent that the $9k check I received (and the subsequent elimination of $12k in debt) aren't actually a net positive economic growth and therefore shouldn't count as an increase in Total Net Worth.
  - This means I need an economic starting point
  - When accounts are added into the system, they should affect the Total Net Worth value
    > For example, when adding a debt account, the daily economic growth should be impacted based on it being a debt or asset...which of course would affect the Total Net Worth (as it currently would for Total Economic Growth).
  - In this way, today's $9k check and elimination of $12k in debt would be balanced out by either the account initially being added into the system or a debit transaction to an existing account (as it currently works).
