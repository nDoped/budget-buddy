## Budget Buddy

A budget and financial tracking app built on a VITL stack (Vue, Inertia, Tailwind, and Laravel)

Create a budget, track your expenses, and see how you're doing with your financial goals.

Categories and Category Types are fully customizable. You decide how you want to categories your expenditure tracking.

Set up recurring transactions to track incoming or outgoing adjustments. Use this to track recurring bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual incomes and debits.

Create Buddy Transactions to track movement between accounts.

That's about it for now. More to come as I build out the app.
