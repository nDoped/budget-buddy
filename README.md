## Budget Buddy

A budget and financial tracking app built on a VITL stack (Vue, Inertia, Tailwind, and Laravel)

Create a budget, track your expenses, and see how you're doing with your financial goals.

Categories and Category Types are fully customizable. You decide how you want to categorize your expenditure tracking.

Set up recurring transactions to track incoming or outgoing adjustments. Use this to track recurring bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual credits and debits.

Create Buddy Transactions to track financial movements between accounts.

Display all of this in a comprehensive dashboard that shows your daily and total economic growth, the balances of all your accounts as they change over time, and a breakdown of all the expenses by category and category type.

That's about it for now. More to come as I build out the app.

## History

The idea of this app grew out of a question I received one day, "What are my recurring monthly expenses?". I had no clue, so I opened a google spreadsheet and went through my bank statements to create a list of recurring transactions. The simple spreadsheet turned into a full blown spreadsheet program in google sheets. This repo started with budget_master.js, a Google Apps Script that integrates with the original spreadsheet program. Eventually, I asked myself, "Why am I doing this?" and created this app in Laravel and Vue, using all of the functionality of the spreadsheet program as a starting point.
